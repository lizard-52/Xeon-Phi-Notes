# Xeon-Phi-Notes
 

This is a repository to keep track of what things I've tried with my Xeon Phi 5110p.

Overview and Compatibility:

Here's my setup:

CPU:            R7 3700x
Motherboard:        MSI X370 Gaming Titanium, AGESA 1.2.0.7
RAM:            2x8GB Samsung B-Die
OS:            Windows 10, Ubuntu 14.10 VM in VMware

The Xeon Phi works in all the slots it fits in as long as “Above 4G Decoding” is on. It does not work properly if I install an Optane SSD in the same computer.
